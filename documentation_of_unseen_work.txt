Tweets Download Speed
The servers that we are downloading twitter data from we very slow so implimenting the bash script to get these files required using the screen command and a VM with a large harddrive in order the let this run for 30+ hours. Then these tar files had to be compiled into a single omnibus file through another bash script (at which point the file was added to a google cloud bucket). 

The process had to be repeated twice since unzipping the files increased the data's harddrive footprint, thus a 4 TB VM had to be rented to fit the data during all of the intermediary steps.


Weather Data Misformating
Data from the NOAA was very poorly formatted and required the dataset to be broken up and remerged in order for the data to be meaningful. sqlite3 could not handle a dataset of this size so another database library had to be used.
