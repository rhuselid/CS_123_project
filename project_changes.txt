Changes since Saturday morning deadline

Regression MapReduce
- this code was almost completly rewritten to not include numpy. This involved a fair amount of linear algebra and iterating over lists of lists.
	- This was necessary because importing/installing numpy lead to permission errors
	- Now this works on a dataproc cluster

Visualizing time series betas
- small script to create a scatter plot of of the geographic distribution of beta scores (as well as their values). This showed no clear relationship.

Sentiment Analysis Mapreduce
- got sentiment analysis mapreduce to work (previously was using a regular python approach reading line by line)
	- global variables removed, init function added, tried many conf file configurations.
- added process_sentiment_analysis_MR.py, which processes the tweets after the sentiment analysis had been run (note that this is a single computer file)
- changed the MR code to yield only primative data types
- added another file to process the output from the code (process_sentiment_analysis_MR.py)

Temperature and Sentiment MapReduce
- built the MR to accurately place the temperature of the closest station to the sentiment of each tweet (which was originally done in pandas)
- was able to output to a txt file 
- changed MR code to yield a stringified dictionary rather than just the temp and sentiment
- Added an init function in the combiner which allowed access to the Temperature csv 

Merge Weather and Station:
- fixed the temperature data by dividing the originally temperature by 10
- specified the month of October to accurately match the tweet data
- merge now works with mapreduce between the two datasets (a nearest neighbor approach)

Time series mapreduce
- added a mapreduce script to deal with compairing the similarity of each user to each user

Visualizations: 
- Added a script to generate matplot figures for each user against users of similar sentiment 
	-> Note: The cluster comparison file (which was the source of the data for the visualizations)
	   was changed over the course of the weekend (required a small tweak with MrJob). 
- (Attempted) to plot average sentiment of each region on a matplot figure but was not able to complete in time. 

Clustering MapReduce Mapreduce
- Added a TopN Mapreduce implementation that finds the top N regions with greatest sentiment. 

Minor Things
- added docstrings to functions
- Removed print statements within mapreduce code
- removed unnecessary imports (e.g. removing MRJob import from the top of sentiment_analysis.py which caused some confusion)
