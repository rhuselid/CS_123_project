Changes since Saturday morning deadline

Regression MapReduce
- this code was almost completly rewritten to not include numpy. This involved a fair amount of linear algebra and iterating over lists of lists.
	- This was necessary because importing/installing numpy lead to permission errors
	- Now this works on a dataproc cluster

Visualizing time series betas
- small script to create a scatter plot of of the geographic distribution of beta scores

Sentiment Analysis Mapreduce
- got sentiment analysis mapreduce to work (previously was using a regular python approach reading line by line)
	- global variables removed, init function added, conf file configured.
- added process_sentiment_analysis_MR.py, which processes the tweets after the sentiment analysis had been run (note that this is a single computer file)
- changed the MR code to yield only primative data types
- added another file to process the output from the code (process_sentiment_analysis_MR.py)


Minor Things
- added docstrings to functions
- Removed print statements within mapreduce code
- removed unnecessary imports (e.g. removing MRJob import from the top of sentiment_analysis.py which caused some confusion)
