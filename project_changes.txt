Changes since Saturday morning deadline


Minor Things
- Removed print statements within mapreduce code
- got sentiment analysis mapreduce to work (previously was using a regular python approach reading line by line)
- removed unnecessary imports (e.g. removing MRJob import from the top of sentiment_analysis.py which caused some confusion)
