Documentation of the work still to be done:

Regression:
	- file works locally with a mix of fake data to represent not yet computed columns, but there have been some errors when it is run on a cluster
	- final results from mapreduce regression are contingent on tweet-weather data nearest neighbor merge

Running the timeseries analysis:
	- Want to add location to each user's tweet sentiment time series so that some location analysis can be done. For example: analyzing all users within a 	certain distance to each other that also have similar tweet sentiments over time. Or locating the k closest people who have a similar tweet sentiment time series to each user is a possibility.
	- Have only ran map reduce (MR_Compare_Users.py and MR_time_series.py) locally. So we must run it on a cluster eventually and will likely have to change the code.
